def predict(image):
    """
    Processes uploaded images and predicts whether leaves are affected by powdery mildew.

    Steps:
    1. Loads the trained mildew detection model.
    2. Preprocesses images:
       - Resizes to match training dimensions (128 by 128).
       - Converts to a normalized NumPy array (values scaled between 0 and 1).
       - Adds a batch dimension for TensorFlow model compatibility.
    3. Runs images through the model to obtain a probability score.
    4. Extracts the raw probability, ensuring proper formatting.
    5. Applies a classification threshold (0.5):
       - If probability < 0.5 â†’ "Healthy" leaf.
       - If probability â‰¥ 0.5 â†’ "Powdery Mildew."
    6. Inverts the probability mapping for "Healthy" classifications to ensure correct confidence display.
    7. Returns the predicted label and confidence percentage.

    Args:
        image (file-like object): The uploaded leaf image in JPG or PNG format.

    Returns:
        tuple: (classification label, confidence score)
               - Label: "Healthy" or "Powdery Mildew."
               - Confidence: Adjusted probability ensuring meaningful confidence representation.
