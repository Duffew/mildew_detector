    st.info(
        "Detection of powdery mildew in cherry leaves currently relies on "
        "manual inspection. We hypothesize that a machine learning model, "
        "trained on images of cherry leaves, could accurately differentiate "
        "healthy leaves from those affected by powdery mildew. This model "
        "could then enable earlier and faster mildew detection."

        "The model’s accuracy in detecting powdery mildew will be evaluated "
        "using a labelled test dataset. If accuracy surpasses 97%, "
        "it will be considered a viable replacement for manual "
        "leaf inspection."

    st.success(
        "The technical page provides evidence to prove that the machine "
        "learning model, developed by this project, exceeds the client's "
        "requirement of 97% accuracy and is well-suited to replace "
        "manual leaf inspection."
