    """
    Displays the hypothesis and validation criteria for the mildew detection project.

    Functionality:
    - ðŸ’¡ **Hypothesis**: Describes how a machine learning model can replace manual inspection 
      for detecting powdery mildew in cherry leaves.
    - âœ… **Validation**: Outlines the performance assessment approach, specifying that the 
      model must achieve at least **97% accuracy** to be considered a viable replacement.

    Streamlit Components Used:
    - `st.title()` â†’ Section headings for hypothesis and validation.
    - `st.info()` â†’ Highlighting hypothesis details.
    - `st.success()` â†’ Emphasizing validation success criteria.

    Returns:
    - None
