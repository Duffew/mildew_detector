    Displays the hypothesis and validation criteria for mildew detection.

    Functionality:
    - üí° **Hypothesis**: Describes how a machine learning model can replace
      manual inspection for detecting powdery mildew in cherry leaves.
    - ‚úÖ **Validation**: Outlines the performance assessment approach,
      specifying that the model must achieve at least **97% accuracy** to be
      considered a viable replacement.
