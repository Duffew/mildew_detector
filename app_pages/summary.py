    st.info("""
    Cherry trees are susceptible to a fungus known as podosphaera clandestine, which presents as a powdery mildew.
    
    - Fungus spores, which winter on or close to the trees, are released in response to rain or irrigation and attach themselves to leaves or new shoots.
    - The spores are most active during the spring, and an infected tree will show signs of mildew within 4-6 weeks of new buds breaking.
    - Powdery mildew usually appears on the leaves of cherry trees and may also be present on stems and the fruit.
    - If left untreated, powdery mildew will reduce the yield of a cherry tree, is contagious for other plants, and will become a perennial problem.
