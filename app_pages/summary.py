    Cherry trees are susceptible to a fungus known as podosphaera clandestine,
             which presents as a powdery mildew.

    - Fungus spores, which winter on or close to the trees, are released
             in response to rain or irrigation and attach themselves to
             leaves or new shoots.
    - The spores are most active during the spring, and an infected tree
             will show signs of mildew within 4-6 weeks of new buds breaking.
    - Powdery mildew usually appears on the leaves of cherry trees and
             may also be present on stems and the fruit.
    - If left untreated, powdery mildew will reduce the yield of a
             cherry tree, is contagious for other plants, and will become
             a perennial problem.
