    Displays a random montage of cherry leaves categorized as 'healthy' or 
    'powdery mildew' within a Streamlit dashboard. This function dynamically 
    selects and arranges images in a structured 3x3 grid format while providing 
    a refresh button for users to generate a new random selection.

    Functionality:
    - Accepts user-selected leaf type ('Healthy' or 'Powdery Mildew') via 
    radio buttons.
    - Dynamically retrieves images from predefined directories using Pathlib.
    - Ensures images persist across selections using Streamlit session state.
    - Displays the images in a clean, structured 3x3 grid layout.
    - Provides a refresh button to generate a new random selection.
    - Formats UI elements to maintain intuitive interaction and alignment.

    Parameters:
    - selection (str): The category of leaves ('Healthy' or 'Powdery Mildew') 
    chosen by the user.
